# Smart-Space-Resource-Management-
A smart system for managing essential space resources — food, water, and oxygen — optimizing usage, minimizing waste, and ensuring sustainability in closed environments. This project is part of the qualifying challenge for the NASA Space Apps Competition, selected for the second phase at the national level.

Overview

Intelligent Space Resource Management is a smart system designed to efficiently manage essential resources such as food, water, and oxygen in space environments. The system focuses on predicting resource needs, optimizing usage, and minimizing waste, ensuring sustainability in closed environments where resources are limited.

This project is part of the qualifying challenge for the NASA Space Apps Competition, selected for the second phase at the national level.

Features

Smart Resource Allocation: Automatically monitors and distributes essential resources to maintain balance and sustainability.

Data-Driven Decisions: Uses analytical models to predict consumption patterns and optimize resource usage.

Visual Monitoring: Graphs and charts provide a clear overview of current and projected resource levels.

Scalable Design: Can be adapted for various space missions, from small-scale simulations to long-term habitat management.

Disclaimer / Note

This project represents a conceptual and innovative approach to managing essential space resources. While the system design, models, and strategies are grounded in scientific principles, some aspects of the implementation may not be currently feasible with existing technology. This work is intended for academic, research, and exploratory purposes, and aims to inspire future development and experimentation in space resource management.
